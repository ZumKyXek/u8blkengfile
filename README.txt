
The u8blkengfile tool
=====================


What is u8blkengfile?
---------------
This is another fast U8 ROT-256 encoder/decoder.
For the story, used in the past to transfer pseudo-random serial data on backup magnetic tape, while respecting the non-return-to-zero criteria.
Since did not found back the original C/QBasic source, then had to recode on modern languages.
For now the D language implementation seem to be the faster.
